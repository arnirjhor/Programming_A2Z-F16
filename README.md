# Programming_A2Z-F16
=====================


##### This is my programming improvement monitoring repo following the course materials [A2Z-F16](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16) from [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net). I hope to continue this as a progressive improvement of my programming skill along with Dan! Hope to get a successful result upon the completion of this syllabus and keeping myself motivated. Thanks for stopping by :)
